<h3>History</h3>
<p>A pioneer for women&#8217;s education and liberal arts education in the United States, Matthew Vassar founded Vassar College in 1861. Opening its doors to its first class of 353 students paying $350 for tuition and &#8220;residence&#8221; on September 26, 1865, the college offered young women a liberal arts education equal to that of the best men&#8217;s colleges of the day. Coeducational since 1969, Vassar College set the standard for higher education for women for more than 100 years and now sets the standard for true coeducation. Recognized as one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country, Vassar has successfully fulfilled its founder&#8217;s goals.</p>
